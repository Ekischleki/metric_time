# Metric time
## Wat da fuq is dat?
Before the french revolution (the first of two more to come), there were a hell of a lot of different units of measurement. An eagle of weight could be equal to 5.43 boulders, a mile was equal to 1760 yards, ect. A bunch of rediculous conversions indeed.
Similarly weird conversions are happening in time as we still use it to this day. A day is equal to about 24 hours, an hour is 60 minutes, a minute is 60 seconds.

So alongside the metric system came metric time. 
- 1 metric day = 10 metric hours,
- 1 metric hour = 100 metric minutes
- 1 metric minute = 100 metric seconds.

Very decimal and extremely French.

A lot of the new systems of measurment were actually adapted and are still used to this day (although somewhat redefined from the original) such as meters, grams and liters. 
Nobody really cared about metric time though, which is why our days don't have 10 hours.
## This project
This project aims to fix that and brings the tradition of french revolution righ to your terminal window by simply fetching the current time and converting it into metric time. 
And that's also all it does, no calendars, no AI llm integration, no free baguettes, just the non-stopping dread of your human existence slowly coming to an end ✨ in decimal ✨. For example, at the time of writing this, the project shows me that it is `6:00:15` from which we can directly conclude that 60% of today have already passed.
